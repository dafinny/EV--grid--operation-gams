## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the operational impact of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) on power system performance using **GAMS-based Optimal Power Flow (OPF)** models. Through four distinct case studies, we simulate how PEVs—ranging from passive loads to active grid participants—affect generation cost, voltage stability, and transmission losses.

## ⚙️ Simulation Cases

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Case 1** | Base case with no EVs integrated |
| **Case 2** | EVs modeled as static loads (charging only) |
| **Case 3** | V2G-enabled EVs supplying both real and reactive power |
| **Case 4** | V2G-enabled EVs supplying reactive power while charging (real power load) |


## 📊 Key Results Summary

| Metric                        | Case 1     | Case 2     | Case 3     | Case 4     |
|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Total Generation Cost ($)    | 3453.30    | 3471.03    | 623.00     | 3456.71    |
| Total Transmission Loss (MW) | 23.00      | 23.03      | 48.29      | 2.29       |
| EV Charging Cost ($)         | —          | 15.29      | 0.00       | 15.29      |
| EV Real Power Discharge (MW) | 0.00       | 0.00       | -4.541     | 0.00       |
| EV Reactive Support (MVAr)   | 0.00       | 0.00       | 0.217      | 0.217      |

✅ **Case 3** results in the lowest cost  
✅ **Case 4** results in lowest losses and improved voltage conditions
